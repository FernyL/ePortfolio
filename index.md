title: Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program, I have delved into a number of different topics. I have been exposed to the Software Development Lifecycle, how the team works together, and how they communicate with stakeholders. These concepts were explored through the course CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle as I learned about how the software development team works together and how they communicate with each other and stakeholders and with the course CS 319: UI/UX Design and Development as I designed a mobile app and worked with stakeholders, specifically users, to test the design to obtain feedback. I have been able to learn about data structures and algorithms in different courses such as DAD 220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments, CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design, and CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming while working with arrays, linked lists, binary trees, and queues. I have had the privilege of working on software engineering, databases, and security within courses such as CS 410: Software Reverse Engineering, CS 405: Secure Coding, and C 465: Full Stack Development I. Throughout these courses I have worked with SQL, MongoDB, and have learned about in depth security policies and documentation. While working through the Computer Science program I have learned the importance of prioritizing user needs, continuously testing throughout the development lifecycle, and applying secure programming principles. 

The two artifacts that were chosen, the Inventory application and Travlr website, fit together as they showcased the categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I was able to expand the complexity of the artifacts by adding a register page to the Travlr website and a search bar to the mobile Inventory application. I showcased my skills in algorithms and data structures by creating a functional search bar to search through items in the Inventory database. I showcased my skills in working with databases and connecting to them to obtain or send data with API endpoints through registering accounts to a database and searching through items in the Inventory database.
